      "Pathogen.jl is a package that provides utilities for the simulation and inference of pathogen phylodynamics, built in the [Julia language](http://julialang.org). Specifically, Pathogen.jl presents an extension to the individual level infectious diesase transmission models (ILMs) of Deardon et al. (2010), to simultaneously model infectious disease transmission and evolution. Pathogen genomic sequences are used in conjunction with the covariate and disease state information of individuals to infer disease transmission pathways, external disease pressure, and infectivity parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "At it's core, an ILM describes the probability an individual will become exposed to a disease in a specific time interval based on their covariate information and the disease state of the rest of the population. In a discrete time ILM, the probability an individual $i$ will become exposed at time $t$ is as (Deardon et al. 2010):\n",

      "In an ILM, a susceptible individual's exposure risk is the sum of various risk factors. The specific source of an infection in this framework, however, is irrelevant. In the phylodynamic ILM extension, the source of an infection is of relevance to the both the pathways of pathogen evolution and of pathogen transmission. As such, it is required that seperate exposure probabilities are described for each susceptible-infectious individual combination. Furthermore, as an individual may only be infected from a single source, we must determine which of the competiting sources (if any) are responsible for their exposure to the pathogen. To do this we are required to model in continuous time, resulting in the following exposure probability:\n",
