    "## An SI model to a Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus experiment\n",
    "In this example we will perform SI model inference using data on the spread of Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV) in a greenhouse from Hughes et al. (1997). In this experiment, 520 plants regularly spaced in a 10m x 26m greenhouse were examined for pressence of TSWV once every two weeks. Plants were not removed after showing signs of infection by TSWV. The experiment concluded after 14 weeks, which saw a total of 327 individual plants infected.\n",
